The objective of this tutorial is to run a Hello World program on QEMU. The
prerequisite is to have a [cross-compiler](https://openrisc.io/software) for
OpenRISC 1000 (or1k). And don't forget to add it to the `PATH`.

# Intro QEMU is a generic emulator that supports various target architectures.
[It can be used to emulate a 32-bit OpenRISC CPU](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/target-openrisc.html).

QEMU has two different modes of emulation: user mode and system emulation mode.
The user mode only allows you to run programs compiled for the target
architecture, while the system mode emulates the complete hardware.

# User Mode

## Install QEMU

Install the pre-built package from your distribution's package manager. On Ubuntu, run:

```bash
sudo apt install qemu-user-static
```

for running statically linked binaries OR

```bash
sudo apt install qemu-user
```

for running dynamically linked binaries. Personally, I am using the static version for this tutorial.

The way this mode of emulation works is that QEMU captures the target's (or1k in
this case) system calls and translates them before passing them to your host system.

## Cross-compile the Program

`hello.c` is included in this directory. Compile it using the cross-compiler you have. For me, the command is\
`or1k-none-linux-musl-gcc hello.c -static -o hello`.

And check if the output file type looks correct using `file` command.

```bash
file hello
hello: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, OpenRISC, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, with debug_info, not stripped
```

Note that `-static` flag was used when compiling. Without this, the output will
be a dynamically linked ELF, which will give an error, ```qemu-or1k-static:
Could not open '/lib/ld-musl-or1k.so.1': No such file or directory```, if we try
to run it using `qemu-or1k-static`.

## Run the Program

```bash
qemu-or1k-static hello
```

If the output is `Hello World!`, then everything is working correctly.

# System Emulation

The following exercise will make a very simple bare-metal or1k system with our `hello.c` program as the "kernel".

## Install QEMU (From Source)

Running QEMU full-system emulation means you need to run a different QEMU binary than what you used for the user mode. On Ubuntu, you can run\
`sudo apt install qemu-system`. **However**, this will download a quite old version of QEMU (likely version 8.2.2) and this does not work with this tutorial. This tutorial was tested to be working on QEMU version 9.2.2.

Because of this, we show how to build QEMU below:
1. Grab a tar ball from https://download.qemu.org/ for the version you like (preferably 9.2.2 or higher)
```
curl -O -L https://download.qemu.org/qemu-9.2.2.tar.xz
```
2. Untar it
```
tar -xf qemu-9.2.2.tar.xz
```
3. Go inside the root directory and run configure
```
cd qemu-9.2.2 && ./configure --target-list="or1k-linux-user or1k-softmmu"
```

Note that during this step, you may encounter a lot of issues with [dependencies required for QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/build-environment.html#debian-ubuntu).

4. Finally, run `make`. The generated binaries should be found inside `/build`.

## Cross-compile the Program
Since we want to run `hello.c` bare-metal (no OS like linux to handle the execution), we need to use the newlib toolchain. [Download the toolchain](https://openrisc.io/software#newlib-toolchain) and untar it like we did for QEMU.
```
curl -O -L https://github.com/stffrdhrn/or1k-toolchain-build/releases/download/or1k-16.1.0-20260704/or1k-elf-16.1.0-20260704.tar.xz
tar -xf or1k-elf-16.1.0-20260704
export PATH=$PATH:<path of or1k-elf bin folder>
```
> One important thing to note is that compiling a C program using a bare-metal cross-toolchain like `or1k-elf-` results in a binary code that directly runs on the hardware. For example, `printf()` in source code gets translated into writing bytes to the UART by `or1k-elf-`. In contrast, `or1k-none-linux-musl-` will translate it into a `write` system call, which in turns gets further handled by the linux OS. 


Then we compile the code, *but* for a specific board. This is done by passing `-mboard` option. There are two boards that can work: `or1ksim-uart` or `ordb1a3pe1500`. The full list can be found [here](https://github.com/openrisc/newlib/tree/or1k/libgloss/or1k/boards).

```bash
or1k-elf-gcc -mboard=ordb1a3pe1500 hello.c -o hello.qemu
# OR
or1k-elf-gcc -mboard=or1ksim-uart hello.c -o hello.qemu
```

## Running the Program

```
./qemu-9.2.2/build/qemu-system-or1k -cpu or1200 -serial mon:stdio -kernel hello.qemu -nographic
```

The expected result of the run should be `Hello World!` being printed out and then hanging.
